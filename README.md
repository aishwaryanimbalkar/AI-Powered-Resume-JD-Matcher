# AI-Powered Resume & Job Description Matcher

This project is an AI-powered system that evaluates a candidate’s resume against a given job description and returns a fit score along with a concise, human-readable explanation. 
The system is built using a modular ASP.NET Core architecture, with a Web API handling resume parsing, semantic similarity scoring, and AI-based explanation generation, and a lightweight MVC-based UI that allows users to upload resumes (PDF) and enter job descriptions. 

For the AI layer, the project uses Ollama as a local LLM runtime to ensure data privacy and avoid reliance on external APIs. Resume–job description similarity is computed using vector embeddings generated by the `nomic-embed-text` model and cosine similarity. 
For explanation generation, the LLaMA 3 model is used due to its strong reasoning capabilities and local availability. 
Prompt grounding techniques are applied by treating the resume as the single source of truth and marking job description–only skills as missing. This results in short, deterministic explanations such as “Strong backend experience but lacks cloud deployment skills,” making the output suitable for UI display and decision support.
